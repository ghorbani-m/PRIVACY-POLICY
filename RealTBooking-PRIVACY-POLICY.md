**PRIVACY POLICY** 

Last updated: January 01, 2025 

**Introduction**  

Real T Booking Inc. (the “**Company**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”) provides services to realtors and service providers, including scheduling, booking and messaging technologies (the “**RealT Services**”), through the use of the website [https://realtbooking.com/](https://realtbooking.com/), our mobile applications including our RealT Agent application and our RealT Provider application, and any other applications that may be developed by the Company from time to time, and portal and corresponding communication tools including email and text (together, the “**RealT Platform**”). The Company is dedicated to maintaining high standards of confidentiality with respect to all information that has been provided to us in connection with the RealT Services, with a particular focus on personal information. The Company respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it by complying with this policy. 

This policy describes: 

*   How we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal information of RealT Platform and RealT Services users (“**you**”). 

*   The types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit or use the RealT Platform or the RealT Services.  

*   Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. 

For clarity, this policy applies in circumstances in which you may use the RealT Services as authorized on behalf of another individual, and in such circumstances, references to “you” and “your” in this policy include the other individual for whom you have the legal authority to seek the RealT Services. We will only use your personal information in accordance with this policy unless otherwise required by applicable law. We take steps to ensure that the personal information that we collect about you is adequate, relevant, not excessive, and used for limited purposes.  

Privacy laws in Canada generally define “personal information” as any information about an identifiable individual, which includes information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person. Personal information does not include business contact information, including your name, title, or business contact information. 

This policy applies to information we collect, use, or disclose about you: 

*   On the RealT Platform. 

*   In email, text, and other electronic messages between you and the RealT Platform. 

*   Through mobile and desktop applications you download from the RealT Platform, through Google Play, the AppStore or other third-party hosted sites or applications, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and the RealT Platform or any other applications of the Company that link to this Privacy Policy. 
*   When you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services if those applications or advertising include links to this policy. 

The RealT Platform may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, services, social networks, or applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share data about you. If you follow a link to a third-party website or engage a third-party plugin, please note that these third parties have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. We do not control these third-party websites, and we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.  

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices for collecting, processing, and storing your information. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the RealT Platform or the RealT Services. By accessing or using the RealT Platform or the RealT Services, you indicate that you understand, accept, and consent to the practices described in this policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Policy). Your continued use of the RealT Platform or the RealT Services after we make changes indicates that you accept and consent to those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

**HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?** 

Our services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins, for example). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform. 

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or that are otherwise made clear to you in respect of the relevant services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by the third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and applications.  

**HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?** 

Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, we will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Under some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your consent. 

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases, subject to any necessary retention to satisfy any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.  

**HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?** 

The security of your personal information is very important to us. We use physical, electronic, and administrative measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.  

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our RealT Platform or the RealT Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the RealT Platform like message boards, which any RealT Platform visitor can view. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our RealT Platform. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the RealT Platform. 

**WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?** 

**Choices About How We Use And Disclose Your Information** 

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information: 

*   Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this RealT Platform may not be accessible or may not function properly. For more information about tracking technologies, see the Section titled Information We Collect Through Cookies in this Privacy Policy. 

*   Promotional Offers from the Company. If you have opted in to receive certain emails from us but no longer wish to have your email address used by the Company to promote our own or third parties’ products or services, you can opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data or at any other time by logging into the RealT Platform and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe link we have included in the email. This opt-out does not apply to information provided to the Company as part of a product purchase, product service experience, or other transactions.  

**Controls For Do-Not-Track Features** 

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“**DNT**”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy. 

**ACCESSING AND CORRECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION** 

It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes. By law you have the right to request access to and to correct the personal information that we hold about you. 

You can review and change your personal information by logging into the RealT Platform and visiting your account profile page. 

If you want to review, verify, correct, or withdraw consent to the use of your personal information you may also send us an email as set forth in the Section titled “How Can You Contact Us About this Privacy Policy?” below, in order to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. In certain circumstances, we cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account.

We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and your right to access, and to provide you with the personal information that we hold about you or make your requested changes. Applicable law may allow or require us to refuse to provide you with access to some or all of the personal information that we hold about you, or we may have destroyed, erased, or made your personal information anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and practices. If we cannot provide you with access to your personal information, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions. 

We will provide access to your personal information, subject to exceptions set out in applicable privacy legislation. 

If you delete your User Contributions from the RealT Platform, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or might have been copied or stored by other RealT Platform users. Proper access and use of information provided on the RealT Platform, including User Contributions, is governed by our Terms and Conditions of Use located at [https://realtbooking.com/terms-and-conditions/](https://realtbooking.com/terms-and-conditions/). 

**WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT** 

Where you have provided your consent to the collection, use, and transfer of your personal information, you may have the legal right to withdraw your consent under certain circumstances. To withdraw your consent, if applicable, contact us by using the contact details provided in the Section titled “[How Can You Contact Us About This Privacy Policy?](https://realtbooking.com/privacy-policy/#contact)“ below.
